## 🏗️ Architecture

### High-Level Overview

```
Frontend (Next.js) → API Gateway (FastAPI) → Services → Database (PostgreSQL) + Cache (Redis)
                                                          ↓
                                                    Celery Workers (Async Tasks)
```

### Architecture Style

- **Phase 1**: Modular Monolith (current)
- **Phase 2**: Microservices-ready (documented)

See [Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- **OpenAI API Key (Optional)** - Only needed if using OpenAI. Hugging Face works locally without API!

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hirelens-ai
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # .env file already exists with default settings
   # Edit .env and configure:
   # - AI_PROVIDER=auto (uses Hugging Face locally, no API costs!)
   # - OPENAI_API_KEY (optional, only if you want to use OpenAI)
   ```

3. **Start services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend python backend/scripts/init_db.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## 🔐 Authentication & RBAC

### Roles

- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Recruiter**: Manage jobs, candidates, resumes, view matches
- **Hiring Manager**: Read-only access to insights

### API Authentication

All API endpoints (except `/api/v1/auth/*`) require authentication:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/
```

## 📊 Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Resume Processing

Upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) and extract using AI:
- **Skills**: Technical and soft skills extraction
- **Experience**: Years of experience calculated from date ranges (handles overlapping periods)
- **Education**: Degrees, institutions, graduation dates
- **Projects**: Project descriptions and technologies used
- **Certifications**: Professional certifications and licenses
- **Languages**: Programming and spoken languages

**Features:**
- AI-based parsing using LLMs for intelligent extraction
- Automatic experience calculation from employment history
- Handles overlapping job periods correctly
- Fallback to rule-based parser if AI parsing fails

**API Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/resumes/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@resume.pdf"
```

### 2. Job Description Intelligence

Create job descriptions and extract:
- Required skills
- Nice-to-have skills
- Experience requirements
- Seniority level
- Education requirements

**API Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/jobs/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Senior Backend Engineer",
    "company": "Tech Corp",
    "raw_text": "We are looking for a senior backend engineer..."
  }'
```

### 3. AI Matching & Scoring

Match candidates to jobs with:
- **Overall Score** (0-100)
- **Skill Match Score** (40% weight)
- **Experience Score** (25% weight)
- **Project Similarity** (20% weight)
- **Domain Familiarity** (15% weight)

**API Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/matching/match?candidate_id=1&job_id=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### 4. Explainable AI

Every match includes:
- **Summary**: Overall assessment
- **Strengths**: 3-5 specific positive points
- **Weaknesses**: 3-5 gaps or concerns
- **Recommendations**: 2-3 actionable items
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low

See [AI Reasoning Documentation](./docs/ai_reasoning.md) for details.

### 5. Candidate Ranking

Get ranked candidates for a job:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/matching/job/1/rankings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Returns candidates sorted by match score with percentile rankings.

## 🧠 AI Engine

### AI Providers Supported

**1. Hugging Face (Recommended - Free & Local)**
- ✅ **Free** - No API costs
- ✅ **Local** - Runs on your machine/server
- ✅ **Private** - Data never leaves your infrastructure
- ✅ **Works Offline** - No internet required after model download
- Models: Sentence Transformers (embeddings), TinyLlama/Mistral (text generation)

**2. OpenAI (Optional - Paid API)**
- Better quality explanations and resume parsing
- Faster API responses
- More accurate experience extraction
- Requires API key and internet

### AI Resume Parsing

The system uses AI to intelligently extract information from resumes:
- **LLM-based parsing**: Uses GPT models for structured data extraction
- **Experience calculation**: Automatically calculates total years from date ranges
- **Overlap handling**: Correctly handles overlapping employment periods
- **Fallback mechanism**: Falls back to rule-based parser if AI parsing fails
- **Configurable**: Enable/disable AI parsing via `USE_AI_RESUME_PARSER` environment variable

### Configuration

In `.env` file:
```env
# Use Hugging Face (Free, Local)
AI_PROVIDER=auto

# Or explicitly use Hugging Face
AI_PROVIDER=huggingface

# Or use OpenAI (requires API key)
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Cost Optimization

- **Hugging Face**: Completely free, runs locally
- **OpenAI**: Aggressive caching (24-hour TTL for embeddings)
- Hash-based cache keys
- Batch processing
- Fallback models when appropriate

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

HireLens AI is designed to scale from 100 to 1 million users:

- **100 users**: Single server, current architecture
- **10k users**: Horizontal scaling, read replicas, Redis cluster
- **1M users**: Microservices, multi-region, distributed database

See [Scaling Documentation](./docs/scaling.md) for detailed strategy.

## 🛠️ Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure .env file in project root
# Set AI_PROVIDER=auto for Hugging Face (free, local)

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py

# Run server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Note**: First time running with Hugging Face will download models (~100MB-1GB). This happens automatically.

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Docker Development:**
- Frontend hot-reloading enabled in Docker
- Webpack polling configured for file change detection
- Changes reflect immediately without container restart

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```
